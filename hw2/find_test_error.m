%FIND_TEST_ERROR Find the test error of a linear separator
%   This function takes as inputs the weight vector representing a linear
%   separator (w), the test examples in matrix form with each row
%   representing an example (X), and the labels for the test data as a
%   column vector (y). X does not have a column of 1s as input, so that 
%   should be added. The labels are assumed to be plus or minus one. 
%   The function returns the error on the test examples as a fraction. The
%   hypothesis is assumed to be of the form (sign ( [1 x(n,:)] * w 
    errors = 0;
    [n, ~]=size(X);
    % if the output does not match the sign
    % error = error + 1 to record the error
    for i = 1:n
        if sign(dot([1 X(i,:)],w)) ~= y(i)
            errors = errors+1;
        end
    end 
    % e_in is the insample error rate
    test_error = errors/n;
